### 🔹 What We See:

### ✅ Proves:  
**Insight:** “Small orders (<$20) sometimes receive high discounts, hurting profitability.”  
**Insight:** “Large orders ($70+) often receive low discounts, reducing the incentive to spend more.”  
**Actionable Step:** Adjust discount strategy by rewarding high-value orders more while limiting discounts on small orders.
